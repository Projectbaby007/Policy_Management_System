Insurance Policy Management System
This project implements a basic policy management system for an insurance company using Python. It demonstrates the management of policyholders, insurance products, and payment transactions through an object-oriented approach.

Features
Policyholder Management:

Register new policyholders with unique IDs.

Suspend and reactivate policyholder accounts.

Associate policyholders with purchased products and made payments.

Product Management:

Create new insurance products with details like name, description, price, and coverage.

Update product information.

Suspend and reactivate products (e.g., for discontinuation or reintroduction).

Payment Management:

Process payments, determining if they are on time or overdue.

Simulate sending payment reminders.

Apply penalties for overdue payments.

Demonstration:

Includes a main.py script to demonstrate the system's functionality by creating policyholders, having them purchase products, process payments (including an overdue one with a penalty), and display their detailed account information.

Project Structure
The project is organized into separate Python files for each core entity, promoting modularity and maintainability.

.
├── policyholder.py
├── product.py
├── payment.py
└── main.py
└── README.md

policyholder.py: Defines the Policyholder class and its methods for managing policyholder accounts.

product.py: Defines the Product class and its methods for managing insurance products.

payment.py: Defines the Payment class and its methods for handling payment transactions.

main.py: The main script to run the demonstration of the policy management system.

README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

How to Run
To run this policy management system demonstration:

Save the files:

Save the content of the policyholder.py immersive block into a file named policyholder.py.

Save the content of the product.py immersive block into a file named product.py.

Save the content of the payment.py immersive block into a file named payment.py.

Save the content of the main.py immersive block into a file named main.py.

Save the content of this README.md immersive block into a file named README.md.

Ensure Python is installed:

You need Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

Navigate to the project directory:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you saved the Python files. For example:

cd /path/to/your/project/folder

Run the main script:

Execute the main.py script using the Python interpreter:

python main.py

You will see the output of the demonstration, showing the creation of policyholders, products, payment processing, and their respective account details, including an example of an overdue payment with a penalty.

How to Package for Submission (Zipped File or GitHub)
Option 1: Zipped File
Create a folder: Put all the Python files (policyholder.py, product.py, payment.py, main.py) and the README.md file into a single directory (e.g., policy_management_system).

Compress the folder:

On Windows: Right-click on the policy_management_system folder, then select "Send to" > "Compressed (zipped) folder".

On macOS: Right-click (or Ctrl-click) on the policy_management_system folder, then select "Compress 'policy_management_system'".

This will create a .zip file (e.g., policy_management_system.zip) that you can submit.

Option 2: GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository:

Go to GitHub and log in.

Click on the "New" repository button.

Give your repository a name (e.g., policy-management-system).

Choose whether it's public or private.

Click "Create repository".

Upload your files:

Follow the instructions on the GitHub repository page to upload your existing files. Typically, you would:

Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder (git init).

Add your files to the staging area (git add .).

Commit your changes (git commit -m "Initial commit of policy management system").

Add the remote GitHub repository (git remote add origin <your_repo_url>).

Push your changes to GitHub (git push -u origin main).

Alternatively, you can manually upload files through the GitHub website interface.

Share the link: Once your files are on GitHub, copy the URL of your repository and share it as your submission.
